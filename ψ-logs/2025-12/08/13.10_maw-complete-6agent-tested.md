# MAW Complete - 6-Agent Auto-Start Tested & Issues Closed

**Time**: 13:10 GMT+7

## What We Learned

- **Full cycle completion** - From issue → implementation → test → close in one session
- **Gitignored files work fine** - `.agents/` and `.codex/` changes are local-only, doesn't pollute repo
- **MCP removal saves tokens** - Removed playwright/chrome-devtools MCPs (~32k tokens saved)
- **Environment sourcing required for bash** - `source .envrc` needed before `maw` commands in subprocess

## How Things Connect

- **Issue consolidation pattern** - #64 absorbed #51 and #42 (agent startup topics)
- **Config hierarchy** - `.envrc` → `CODEX_HOME` → `.codex/config.toml` → codex behavior
- **Profile → Layout → Windows** - profile8.sh defines type, start-agents.sh creates WINDOW_0/WINDOW_1

## Key Discoveries

- **Node = running agent** - Both Claude and Codex show as `node` in tmux pane_current_command
- **Pane 2.3 = monitor** - Stays as `zsh`, runs `maw status watch`
- **Issue closure with comments** - `gh issue close N --comment "..."` is clean workflow

## Commits This Session
- `0d25039` learn: MAW 6-agent autostart with codex config

`maw` `6-agents` `profile8` `issue-cleanup` `tested` `complete`

## Raw Thoughts

- Session felt efficient - clear goal, executed, tested, closed
- The snapshot→commit→push→close cycle is smooth
- Could template this workflow for future features
