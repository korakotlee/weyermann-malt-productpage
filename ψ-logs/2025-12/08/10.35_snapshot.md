# Snapshot: Context-finder + Snapshot commands

**Time**: 10:35 GMT+7
**Branch**: main

## Context Links
- **Issues**: #60 (plan: /snapshot), #61 (test snapshot), #50 (context-finder)
- **Commits**:
  - `be0e0d1` 10:34 - feat: /snapshot command - unified ccc + knowledge-save
  - `3ac3980` 10:29 - fix: context-finder regex filter for emoji prefixes
  - `31bb9f9` 10:26 - feat: context-finder default mode - auto-gather recent context
- **Tags**: `context-finder` `snapshot` `command` `feat` `fix`

## What Happened
- Implemented `/context-finder` default mode (no args = recent context summary)
- Fixed regex for emoji prefixes in jq filters
- Created `/snapshot` command combining ccc + knowledge-save
- Tested both commands successfully

## Key Discoveries
- `startswith()` in jq fails with emoji - use `test()` regex instead
- Dual output (GitHub issue + local log) provides both tracking and fast search
- Auto-tagging from commit types reduces friction

## Files Touched
```
Clean working directory
```

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md short codes to include /snapshot
- [ ] Consider deprecating separate ccc and knowledge-save
- [ ] Extend pattern to other subagents

## Raw Thoughts
- Session was productive: 2 features + 1 fix in ~20 minutes
- The gogogo workflow with plan issues works well
- context-finder + snapshot = good session bookends
