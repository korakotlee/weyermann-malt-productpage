# Session: Knowledge Architecture & Archiver Refinement

**Time**: 09:20 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~60 min

## 🔗 Context Links
- **Issues**: #47, #48, #49
- **Commits**: `247c833`, `6f0b539`, `74effbb`, `87b4742`, `052c2f2`, `eca7c7e`, `8077bfa`, `c6e12ad`
- **Branch**: main
- **Tags**: `archiver` `subagent` `haiku` `prompt-engineering` `knowledge-management` `retrospective` `short-codes`

## What Happened
- Tested archiver subagent on short codes topic
- Archived unused short codes: sss, ttt, lll
- Analyzed rrr retrospective token consumption (~5,750 tokens)
- User insight: retrospectives are book material, not waste
- Designed 3-layer knowledge management system
- Created /knowledge-save (Layer 1) and /distill (Layer 2) commands
- Renamed from sss/til to clearer names

## Quick Notes
- Archiver prompt needed 6 iterations to get 10/10 (haiku needs STRICT templates)
- Token "cost" reframed as "investment" when output is book source material
- Traceability is the KEY - all layers must link to issues/commits/tags

## Files Touched
```
.claude/commands/knowledge-save.md (new)
.claude/commands/distill.md (new)
CLAUDE.md (updated short codes section)
ψ-learnings/subagent-prompt-engineering.md (created earlier)
```

## Raw Thoughts
- 3-layer system makes sense: raw → distilled → narrative
- User has clear vision: retrospectives become book chapters
- The more we link, the easier context-finder can search
- Maybe book-writer subagent could compile retrospectives into chapters?
- Issue #42 (auto-start Codex) still pending - could be next focus
